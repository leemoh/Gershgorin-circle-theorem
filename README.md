Let A  be a complex n × n   matrix, with entries a i j. For i ∈ { 1 , … , n }  let R i = ∑ j ≠ i | a i j |  R_{i}= be the sum of the absolute values of the non-diagonal entries in the i-th row. Let D ( a i i , R i ) ⊆ C  D(a_{ii},R_{i})  {C} be a closed disc centered at a (ii)  with radius R{i}  . Such a disc is called a Gershgorin disc and can be illustrated using Python.
